## Git Help
If you are completely new to git or would like a refresher, look at the provided [tutorial](https://youtu.be/8JJ101D3knE?feature=shared) and [cheat sheet](education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).

Some important best practices
1) Do not commit to the main branch. Once a pipeline is running, this won't be possible anyway. Commit changes to a parallel branch and merge.
2) Review and request reviews for any major merge requests.
3) Use git pull often to receive updates from the repo
